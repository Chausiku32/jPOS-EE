=== FlyWay Support

The `db-flyway` module can be used to run FlyWay migrations from the jPOS command line interface.

It picks the DataSource configuration from the standard DB configuration used by jPOS (that can
be defined in the `db.properties` file, or a target _Environment_.

When running `q2 --cli` (or reaching a running Q2 server using SSH), there's a
new `flyway` subsystem. Inside the `flyway` subsystem you can find the following
commands:

- `clean`
- `info`
- `baseline`
- `migrate`
- `validate`
- `repair`

All Flyway commands take into account possible environment variables, defined in `cfg/default.yml`, i.e.:

[source,yaml]
-------------
flyway:
    table: schema_version <1>
-------------
<1> Sets `flyway.table` property, in this example, we override the new default value `flyway_schema_history` for
    backward compatibility.
