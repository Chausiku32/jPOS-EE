The `syslog` table is a general purpose table used by jPOS-EE to record
an audit trail of relevant events.

The table has the following columns:

- `id` : auto-generated ID
- `date`: timestamp
- `deleted`: logical delete indicator
- `source`: application specific source (i.e. node name)
- `severity`: we use DEBUG = 0, TRACE = 1, INFO  = 2, WARN  = 3, ERROR = 4, CRITICAL=5
- `summary`: a brief description of the event, suitable to be printed by the UI in a column
- `detail`: specific info about the event
- `trace`: additional information (i.e. dumps)
